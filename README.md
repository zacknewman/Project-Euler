# Project-Euler
My solutions to some of the problems on Project Euler.
All of my solutions are done in both Python and Haskell.
Most of the functions used to solve the problems on Project Euler are
generalized. Much effort was put into using math to either completely solve or greatly
simplify the problem for the computer. In addition to the challenge and fun of
using some of my math background to handle these problems, the time it takes
the computer to compute the solutions tends to be greatly reduced and can be
used to calculate much larger and more general problems.
